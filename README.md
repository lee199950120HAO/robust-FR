# Robust Global Fréchet Regression via Weight Regularization
This repository provides R code for robust global Fréchet regression via weight regularization, proposed in the following paper:


Li, H., Sugasawa, S., and Katayama, S.Robust(2026) Global Fréchet Regression via Weight Regularization [arXiv:2511.03694.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03694)

The repository includes the following 3 files.

- `code-simulation-distribution.R`: implementing code for distribution-valued outcomes, designed to evaluate robustness and predictive performance under contamination observtiona.

- `code-simulation-matrix.R`: implementing code for matrix-valued outcomes, demonstrating robustness from weight regularization in global Fréchet regression.

- `type2matric.R` Demonstrating the data-generating process for the second type of matrix-valued response.
