This repository provides R code for R code for robust global Fréchet regression via weight regularization, proposed in the following paper:


Li, H., Sugasawa, S., and Katayama, S.Robust(2026) Global Fréchet Regression via Weight Regularization [arXiv:2511.03694.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03694)

The repository includes the following 3 files.
- `code-simulation-distribution.R`: code for distribution-valued outcomes, designed to evaluate robustness and predictive performance under contamination observtiona.

- `code-simulation-matrix.R`: code for matrix-valued outcomes (including contaminated settings), demonstrating robustness from weight regularization in global Fréchet regression.

- `type2matric.R` demonstrates the data generating process of the second type of matrix response
