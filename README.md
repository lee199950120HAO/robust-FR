The repository includes the following 3 files.

- `code-simulation-distribution.R`: implementing code for distribution-valued outcomes to evaluate robustness under contaminated observations

- `code-simulation-matrix.R`: implementing code for matrix-valued outcomes to demonstrate robustness

- `type2matric.R` Demonstrating the data-generating process for the second type of matrix-valued response.
